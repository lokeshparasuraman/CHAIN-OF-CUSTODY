# Chain of Custody System - Phase Report

## Frontend Development

### Templates & UI Components
- Implemented comprehensive user interfaces:
  - Authentication pages (login, register)
  - Case management interfaces (add_case, view_case, view_casefull)
  - Evidence handling (add_evidence, view_auth)
  - Administrative panels (admin, add_regulator)
  - Access control interfaces (access, allow)
  - Notification system (view_noti, view_req)

### Styling & Design
- Utilized modern CSS frameworks and custom styling:
  - Bootstrap integration for responsive design
  - Custom CSS with SASS preprocessing
  - Flexbox layouts for modern UI components
  - Animated components using animate.css
  - Icon integration (icomoon, flaticon)
  - Image galleries and carousels (owl.carousel)

### JavaScript Features
- Rich client-side functionality:
  - jQuery for DOM manipulation
  - Bootstrap.js for interactive components
  - Google Maps integration
  - Custom animations and transitions
  - Form validation and handling
  - Dynamic content loading

## Backend Development

### Database Architecture
- MySQL database implementation with tables for:
  - User management (coc_register, coc_login)
  - Case management (coc_case)
  - Evidence tracking (coc_evidence)
  - Access control (coc_access, coc_allow)
  - Request handling (coc_request)
  - Attack prevention (coc_attack)

### Security Features
